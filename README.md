The following app is used by managers to easily create employee profile summaries, based on a series of questions and is output into a template. 

You may begin by opening the app.js file in the terminal and typing "node app.js".
This will prompt a series of questions first asking you (the manager) the following:
  1. What is your name?
  2. What is your work ID?
  3. What is your email?
  4. What is your Office Number?
After these fields have been filled out, the next prompt will ask if you have anymore employees?
If you select 'no' the output file will be created. And no further action will be required.
If you select yes, this will prompt another series of questions relating to that employee, with different questions depending on if they are an intern or engineer.
Once all desired employees have been entered and the 'no' option has been selected for additional employees, an output file titled team.html will be created in the output folder.

Enjoy!
